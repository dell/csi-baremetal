# Proposal: Fake Attach Volume

Last updated: June 11 2011


## Abstract

Fake Attach Volume feature should allow Pod to come up after a restart even when a volume is unhealthy.

## Background

Some storage and streaming systems consolidate access to the persistent volumes by mounting them to a single Pod.
Thus single volume failure might prevent service to run and cause data unavailability on remaining.
 
## Proposal

If a volume is inaccessible when a Pod is being restarted, the BM CSI will fake the attach temporary volume in
read-only mode.

## Rationale

Alternative approach might be implementing custom logic in Pod Controller to delete PVC from the requirements on mount
failure.

## Compatibility

This feature will require application Operator to put specific annotation on PVC
`pv.attach.kubernetes.io/ignore-if-inaccessible: yes`

## Implementation

When `pv.attach.kubernetes.io/ignore-if-inaccessible: yes` annotation is set CSI must ignore NodeStageVolume errors and
put `fake-attach: yes` annotation on CSI Volume CR. On NodePublishVolume CSI must check `fake-attach` annotation and mount
tmpfs volume in read-only mode.

Command to mount tmpfs volume: `mount -t tmpfs -o size=1K -o ro tmpfs <destination folder>`

CSI must generate event to notify user about this Fake-Attach Volume.

On NodeUnstage tmpfs volume must be deleted.
